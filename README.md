# suplex

`suplex` is a typed eDSL to construct typed C-like programs in OCaml and run them
efficiently using LLVM. This language aims to be a target for metaprogramming
efficient numerical algorithms.

This library is still in the experimental stage: APIs are not stabilized yet.

Have a look at the [documentation][doc-link].
